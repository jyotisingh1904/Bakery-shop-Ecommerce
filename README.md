This a bakery e-commerce project developed using django framework.
It has basic functionalities but a good initiative if you are new to django.
Download all the files and extract then run manage.py
You can refer any video on how to run a dhango project. Its setup is not so tough.
You can access the backend using django administrator by creating a superuser.
Good luck with the project! Contact me on linkedin if any query!!
